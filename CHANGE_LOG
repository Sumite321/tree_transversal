HPEnd 7.2

* added ability to transverse a tree using DFS
* minor big fixes

*********************************************************
Older version
Version 7 - HpEnd

* re-designed and re-invented version 5
* objects are no longer instantiated using lists
* self.obj removed
* added new feature - Auto Root; Automatically finds the root
* new algorithm implemented; objects are instantiated, assigned and sorted
using a single loop
* removed lists (ID,tmp)
* removed unecessary loops(IDs,inst)
* get_content and set_content no longer used
* major bug fixes



Version 5.1 - RollBX

* rollback to version 5

Version 6.2

* temporary bug changed to permanently fixed
* minor pointer fixes


Version 6.1

* Bug fixed (temporary)
* pointer added (set_content -> self.id)
* get_all_nodes_<method> now returns id node with content


Version 6 - ADvd

* New algorithm implemented
* Added ability to transverse a tree with unlimited nodes
* set_content and get_content fixed
* bf_nodes method now uses get_content
* Added ability to read an unordered tree and automatically sort it
* Create objects dynamically

Version 5

* Implemented "linked list" style tree tranversal
* instantiation happens using lists

Version 4 - Majrx

* skips version 3 due to major updates
* nodes are now instantiated dynamically accessing a list
* method to sort using BFS implemented
* tree is built using BFS
* new effecient way to find for ids and edges
* new logical method to recognize parents and edges from txt files


Version 2

* fully new algorithm; 2 classes implemented
* Node class gets ID and nodes from txt file and uses the methods
* Tree class reads txt file, builds and sorts the tree
* Nodes created manually



Version 1 - Initial release

* Initial algorithm reads the file, extrats the ids and edges from it
* Uses BFS and returns the nodes in order
