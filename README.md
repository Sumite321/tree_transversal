# tree_transversal

As part of an Assignment for Artifical Intelligence, the task was to create to read a txt file, create a tree consisting of nodes and return in Breadth-First and Depth-First order. 

The program consists of 2 classes; one to create nodes and the other one to create the tree. The Tree class will extract the data from the txt file and for each 'number', the Node class will instantiate objects. These objects will hold information such as 'parents','childs' the node will have. 

Under the Tree class, it will create the actual tree and return nodes in BFS/DFS order.
